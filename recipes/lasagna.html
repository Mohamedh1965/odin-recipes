    <h1>Lasagne Verdi al Forno</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/images/lasagne.jpg">
   
    <p></p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy; this lasagna made with spinach pasta cannot be beat. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests, or even yourself. It may be a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>
